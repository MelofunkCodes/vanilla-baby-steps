Replicating the exercises found  in https://github.com/DecodeMTL/vanilla-js-projects


Playing around with VanillaJS and learning about:

1. Creating and manipulating elements *(querySelector)*
2. Handling events *(addEventListener)*
    - Stopping to listen to an event *(removeEventListener)*
    - Default event behaviours *(event.preventDefault())*
    - Event bubbling *(stop with event.stopPropagation())*
    - **Event Delegation** *(adding one eventListener to target a parent where many children can be added versus adding eventListener for EACH child)*
3. Making HTTP Requests *(Fetching the subreddit for Montreal and displaying the post titles as links on own webpage)*
